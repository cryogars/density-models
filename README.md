  <summary><h2>Installation and Setup</summary>

This project uses *Conda* for environment management. However, you can use any environment management tool of your choice. For example, you can manage Python versions with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and create a virtual environment using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Go to **Step 3** if you wish not to use *Conda*.

### 1. Install Conda

If you donâ€™t have Conda installed, download **[Anaconda or MiniConda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)**. See [Installing Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to know which installer is right for you.

### 2. Create and Activate the Conda Environment

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate ml_density_env 
```

### 3. Installation (Non-Conda Users)

For those not using Conda, you can set up a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```bash
python -m venv ml_density_env
source ml_density_env/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
```

Note: the Python version will be the default version on your PC. You can manage Python version using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

### 4. Create and Navigate to Directory

```bash
mkdir ml_density
cd ml_density
```

### 5. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryogars/density-models.git
cd density-models
```

### 6. Verify Installation

Ensure everything is set up correctly:
```bash
python --version  # Should return 3.11.5
pip list  # Displays installed packages
```

### 7. Run Tests (Optional)

To verify the models are working correctly, you can run the tests:

```bash
pytest # Run all tests
```

### 8. Install Source Code

```bash
pip install .
```

If you wish to modify the source code, install in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Note**: This project uses `conda` to manage only manage the Python version and install Jupyter. All package dependencies are installed via `pip`. We found this approach avoids dependency conflicts that sometimes occur when mixing conda-installed and pip-installed packages in the same environment.

  <summary><h2>Deactivate and/or Remove Environment</summary>

After running the experiments, you can deactivate the conda environment by running the command below:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

To completely remove the environment, run:
```bash
conda env remove --name ml_density_env
```
